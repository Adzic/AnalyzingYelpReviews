# Analyzing Yelp Reviews using AWS and EMR 

In this project I've analyzed 10 Gb of Yelp's dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).  <br />
I have used Several features of AWS. First dataset has been downloaded on a local host and then uploaded to S3.  <br />
After that I've levered EMR for data analysis using PySpark. Here are pictures of Notebook as well as Cluster configurations:
